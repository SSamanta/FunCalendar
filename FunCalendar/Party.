* Tapped Calendars, and without tapping anything tapped Done.  The
app crashed (but it should not crash).
* If you tap a row, there's a brief period of time where two rows
are selected (the old and new row).  This is not standard behavior -
it should be that when you tap a row only one is selected at a time.
* Table view rows should show dates of events along with names
* Project should also demonstrate:
* Creating calendars (from Calendars page, remove done button and
add a + there)
* Deleting calendar entries (swipe to delete on the table view
cells is fine)
* Programatically creating events with eventWithEventStore:
(tapping + button on main page should bring up a prompt - "add manual"
or "add programattic")
* Searching for events to detect if programmatic event already
added with enumerateEventsMatchingPredicate:usingBlock:.
* Look through the EventKit guide for any functionality you have
not already covered. Again, remember tutorials for this site need to
be in-depth, not just basic coverage.

Let me know when these are addressed and I'll take another look
